----Things to keep in mind-----------	
	1. When initiating the process it will be assigned automatically to
		i. the user of the Role of Start event present
		ii. also to the user who is having less pending tasks
	2. When naming Process flow elements don't use space use _ instead
	3. Separate tables will be created for each tasks in the format [GEN_<ProcessID>_<TaskName>] Eg.[GEN_2147_Task_05yvzrx_xrpv]
	4. BPMExec will store the user who is creating\initiating the process and not the user it will be assigned to.
			
----Queries/Bugs--------------------------	
	1. All elements in the Process flow must have the code - but no validation for it*********Issue1-Fixed
	2. Names should be inserted to differentiate the output Tasks when using ExGate - but no validation for it*********Issue2
	3. Gateways consecutively can come? Two Exclusive Gateways(Parallel Gateway can come) consecutively won't come
	4. More than one End/Start event will come? scenarios like multiple start\end won't come(multiple end allowed, single end from diff task allowed, for multiple start error)
	5. If 2nd Point possible will it come for different Role? (End for different Role allowed)
	6. For Parallel Gateway, how many tasks allowed(both input/output)? no restriction
	7. If 4th Point possible will it connect between different Role? yes
	8. More than one Participant will come? No Need of it
	9. Single End event from many Tasks can possible? yes
	10.In ExGate if Continue given directly, then its not moving to any user*********Issue3-Fixed
	11.ExGate button text not applied correctly - Names should be inserted to differentiate the output Tasks
	12.How will work if Button control given in the Tasks?*********Issue4
	13.What will happen when the ExGate and input given in diff role? It's coming in the same role
	14.Even its Mandatory Form is contine to Next stage*********Issue5-Fixed
	15.Check how the tools are loading - bpm-modeler.js
	16.If any columns updated, both the old and new columns coming in the History**********Issue6
	17.Version number not started from 1 when created from use as template************Issue7
